# EchoMind  
### The Human-Like, Offline AI Voice Assistant

**EchoMind** is a next-generation AI voice assistant that feels less like a chatbot and more like a real assistant.

> Talk naturally. Be remembered. Stay private.

## 🚀 Why EchoMind?

Most assistants are cloud-dependent, impersonal, and forgetful.  
EchoMind is different.

- ✅ **Offline-first**
- ✅ **Human-style conversation**
- ✅ **Persistent personal memory**
- ✅ **Multi-agent intelligence**
- ✅ **No data leaves your machine**

EchoMind is designed as a **personal AI operating system**, not just a voice bot.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

### 🎙️ Natural Voice Interaction
- **Whisper** for accurate speech-to-text
- **Edge TTS & Piper** for expressive, low-latency speech

- Routing between local and external tools

This allows EchoMind to **think before it speaks**.

## 🧩 How EchoMind Thinks

1. User speaks naturally  
2. Whisper converts speech → text  
3. Intent & emotion are analyzed  
4. Multi-agent system decides next action  
5. Phi-3 generates a response  
6. Memory agent updates long-term context  
7. Edge TTS / Piper speaks back  

This pipeline enables **fluid, emotionally aware conversation**.
